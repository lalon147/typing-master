        <h1>Differences between Global scope And Function Scope</h1>
        <p>A variable Declared with Var can be accessed in every where inside the file
            so it is called global scoped which is something that free to use and free for all like variables declared here can be used anywhrere in that particular file 
            On the Other hand Functuion scope is something really interesting it is kind of a capsulated area like variable Declared here can be used only inside that particular function and nowhere else
